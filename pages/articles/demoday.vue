        <p>We went to the Demo Day in 2018. Let us resume you the event</p>
        <h1>First part</h1>
        <p>In 2018, it was the 4th edition of the Demo Day. Before going there, you have to register on the Facebook page of the event. Then, the D-day you will check in before entering in a large room where the event will take place.</p>
        <p>During the 1st part, every big structure involved in this event present itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tran Van Tung, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology</b>, presented the event and show its support for innovative structures as incubators or accelerators which give the opportunity to expand the innovation and develop the entrepreneurial spirit in Vietnam.</li>
            <li><b>Representatives of Vietnam Silicon Valley</b>, explained the benefices of Accelerator Bootcamp program done by the start-ups for 4 months and the development of innovative ecosystem in Vietnam supporting by the government and innovative structures. They also thank the Ministry of Science and Technology to be part of this event and warmly welcomed the CEO of Lotte Accelerator.</li>
            <li><b>Jin Sung Rhee, CEO of Lotte Accelerator</b>, said he was confident in the VSV-Lotte collaboration that contributes in economics development adding "South Korean startup booster will expand and diversify its investment capital in Vietnam’s startup ecosystem this year"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This 1st part made us realize the considerable development of innovation in Vietnam supporting by important structures as VSV or Lotte. In fact, Vietnam Silicon Valley is a network of more than 40 local and international mentors and investors supporting innovation. In 2017, VSV signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Microsoft Vietnam and Lotte accelerator to support incubation and start-up investments, even the government is starting to give support to this ecosystem</p>
        <p>Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing but stable economies in SouthEast Asia. During the four first months in 2017, Vietnam has seen an augmentation of 14% of the start-ups number according to the French consulate in Hô Chi Minh</p>
        <p>The events in Vietnam are opened to the public, that’s why you should have a look and maybe, in the future, be the next entrepreneur presenting its project !</p>
        <p>It’s an opportunity to discover a new side of Vietnam and to meet important people that could help you later in your professional project</p>
        <h1>Second part</h1>
        <p>During the second part, the animator of the event introduced quickly the 10 start-ups that was going to show their project in front of investors</p>
        <p>After having done a complete 4 months Accelerator Bootcamp program (a program offered by Vietnam Silicon Valley), those start-ups show in few minutes their business model and the results got by their project on the Vietnamese market.</p>
        <p>The start-ups had prepared their pitches with the Vietnam Silicon Valley, making sure to be clear, straightforward and attractive for the investors.  It’s a bite stressful to see them having a limited time to highlight their projects and results without having an explanation on all the work they have done, all the obstacles they struggled with, to arrive there.</p>
        <p>One by one, presentations are done, with a final time for asking question to the speaker to get more details on each project</p>
        <p>Quick overview of the 10 start-ups of the 2018 Demo Day :</p>

        <h1>Third part</h1>
        <p>After each start-up had made its presentation, everybody is invited to join the buffet where the connection between entrepreneurs and investors can be made. This time is suitable to have a discussion and have a feeling. Investors can get more details from projects and finally talk about consensus for potential investments</p>
        <p>To attract more investors, VSV had decided to give the possibility for investors to follow, during the 4 months Bootcamp program, all the projects including in the program. This decision has been made to facilitate investment decisions in giving more details about what the entrepreneurs had done during 4 months</p>
        <p>Finally, year after year, the Demo Day welcome more and more investors and the number of start-up asking for the program is also increasing</p>
        <p>It’s an event where people are approachable and open for discussions. An interesting way to discover the network and ecosystem of the innovative Hanoï !</p>
        <p>To resume, the goal of the Demo Day is to create opportunities for start-up to show their projects, results on the markets but also talk about their potential growth to investors. More than a presentation, it gives the chance for entrepreneurs to meet investors and find a solution to their lack of capital at the beginning of their business. Finally, this meeting can also be a way to get feedback on its project by professionals or an outside person</p>
